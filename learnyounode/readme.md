## Personal notes

TLDR: `learnyounode` is not made just for beginners.

Although I had been playing with Node.js for months (actually a few years) before I completed `learnyounode` workshops, I still was considering myself as a beginner at that time.
Completing `learnyounode` workshops made me realize that I learnt a lot during these months (years), and maybe one could say now that I'm not such a newbie after all that learning.
Although you might think you don't need to spend some time on `learnyounode`, the thing is that it will make you more aware of your capabilities regarding your usage of Node.js.

Many thanks to [`learnyounode` creators and contributors](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode#contributors) for these awesome exercises!
